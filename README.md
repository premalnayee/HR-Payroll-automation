Project: HR is an extensive role within a company, with responsibilities ranging from employee on boarding to payroll. With this
project we will be looking closely at the payroll process and evaluating how it can be automated to save time and costs. The
current process includes many sections such as receiving emails for hours worked so this can be updated onto the database
for both consultants and employees. These details will be passed to the payroll team so they can extract relevant
information to make payslips for the payments to be processed. This has been identified as the perfect candidate for
automation due to its sequential nature.

In the three folders /Collate hour worked from employees ReFramework, /Collate hours worked from contractors Reframework, /Payslip process you will find separate processes based on the performer and dispatcher model. Each of the processes are called using triggers in UiPath Orchestrator and imformation is transferred between them using assets.
